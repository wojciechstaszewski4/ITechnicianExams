## IT Technician Exams EE.09/E.14 ##

Welcome to my site dedicated also to my repository. You will ask, why is this page there? Well, it was developed by me as part of easier access and search for the files we need. I think it's worth starting with what GitHub is and what it offers us.

And it has many functions, because:
- It provides hosted repositories,
- Provides code snippets to other developers on the team,
- Shares code with the GitHub community,
- Creates open source projects,
- Can serve as a programmer's portfolio,
- Observes other people's projects.

GitHub is a service that allows us to host repositories and share them with other developers. Most importantly, to our colleagues. Thus, GitHub is a tool that facilitates teamwork, with version control. Nowadays, GitHub can also serve as a portfolio.
Often IT recruiters searching for programmers on behalf of their clients will find pieces of code in the technology they are looking for.

You can find a lot of good stuff in my resource. It's all about issues related to the professional exam in the practical category on the IT technician profile. My repository consists of:
- Sheets,
- JavaScript,
- Tasks.

The first resource includes the exam sheets EE.09 and E.14. As you know, under the new reform, the former replaced the latter, but they are very similar in terms of the requirements they impose on the passer.
That is why he performs these as well as these. Thanks to them you can get acquainted with the solutions to the sample practice sheets. Each catalog contains the necessary information for this.

The second subpage covers my JavaScript assignments. I performed them based on lessons in my school. Each of them is described, so it is impossible to confuse what is currently being done.
This is referenced throughout my repository. It's all described and arranged so that you can easily find the content you're interested in.

The third and final branch relates to the tasks I have done so far in my school classes. After entering the tab, we have a choice of JavaScript tasks or other simple activities.
In them we can get acquainted with the issues and the execution of particular commands and instructions.
